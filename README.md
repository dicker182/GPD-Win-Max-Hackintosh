# GPD-Win-Max-Hackintosh
Hello, everyone. This is a repository discussing how to install Mac OS Catalina (or newer version) on GPD Win Max.

Thanks to all the volunteers who participated in this project. We have achieved the minimal requirement to use Mac OS on this little machine.

However, there's still some difficult problem need to be solved. We are currently trying to solve them in our leisure time. The progress may very slow. If you are also interested, join us to solve them together.

# What's working
* All usb port works include two type-c port. (TODO: Need to test if USB3 works)
* Both two type-c port can connect to external type-c to DP or HDMI monitors. I have tested BQNQ 4K monitor without problem.
* Joystick emulated mouse works.
* Gigabyte ethernet port works.
* Native keyboard works.
